This dashboard  is a data visualization of the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (UCDP GED), a project within the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), at the Department of Peace and Conflict Research, Uppsala University.

The aim of this report is to better understand the different conflicts around the world. Our data covers all conflicts from **1989 to 2020.**  

Several dimensions of the problem will be highlighted. Like the **evolution over time** , the **geographical locations** , the 
**type of violence** , and some quantitative data like the number of **victims and conflicts.**
